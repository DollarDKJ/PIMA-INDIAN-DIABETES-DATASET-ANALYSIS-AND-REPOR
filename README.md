# PIMA-INDIAN-DIABETES-DATASET-ANALYSIS-AND-REPORT

This report shows the analysis of the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset of the women population in the Pima Indian heritage.

The objective of the analysis is to know if any of the diagnostic measurements included in the dataset is the cause of diabetes in patients.

I performed the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization using Python. Zero values in the dataset were substituted with the mean of each category.

# Insights:
There are 768 records and 9 rows in the dataset.

The mean age is 33.24.

35% of the sample data are diabetic.

The histogram illustrating Insulin by age highlights higher insulin production levels in the age group 21–30.

The dataset predominantly comprises non-diabetic individuals (Outcome 0) compared to diabetic cases (Outcome 1). This is depicted in the pie chart as (65.1%) non-diabetes and (34.9%) diabetic.

Women between ages 30–40 have high BMI.

# Conclusion:
The Pima Indian Diabetes dataset shows high occurrence of diabetes in women with high BMI and low insulin production levels, it also shows a high people under age 30 who visit the gym have low diabetes incidents.

# Recommendations:
1. Diabetes awareness programs should be more frequent to help with early detection.

2. Regular checkups should be encouraged.

3. Ensuring regular sugar level test.

4. Continuous nutritional awareness for patients with diabetes is key for managing the condition because most times we are what we eat.
